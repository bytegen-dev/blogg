                        Have you ever worked with a very charismatic leader? If so, then it's likely that almost everyone in the organization liked, trusted and admired this person.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        People listened when they talked, colleagues supported their ideas, and talented people wanted to join their team. In short, everyone wanted to be around this person!
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        Charisma is something that many people believe you're born with. However, this isn't the case â€“ you can become more charismatic, and we'll explore how you can develop charisma in this article.

                    <h3>Defining Charisma</h3>

                    <p>
                        Charisma is a collection of traits and behaviors that make you appeal to other people. The word comes from the Greek word "charis," which means "grace" or "gift."
                    </p>

                    <div class="charis charisi">
                        <img src="./img/char-girl.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        A person who is charismatic is exceptionally engaging, likable, trustworthy, and, in many cases, a bit "magical." Larger-than-life personalities like Marilyn Monroe, Martin Luther King, Jr, Oprah Winfrey, and Sir Richard Branson have all been known for their charismatic personalities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        People with charisma are assertive, confident, inspiring, and warm. They make a point of listening to others, and they have an innate grace that often stops people in their tracks.
                    </p>

                    <div class="charis charisii">
                        <img src="./img/bravery.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        As such, it's great to be charismatic in business, even if you're not in a leadership role. When you have charisma, people want to work with you. They're drawn to your ideas, they trust your opinion, and they're more likely to be influenced by you.
                    </p>
